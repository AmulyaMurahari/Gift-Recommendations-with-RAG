# Enhancing Gift Recommendatios Using RAG Pipeline

## Project Overview
This project utilizes the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to create a sophisticated gift recommendation system. By integrating dense retrieval with a sequence-to-sequence model, the system personalizes gift suggestions based on user input and trends captured from various data sources.

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Generates gift suggestions tailored to individual preferences and occasions.
- **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Leverages dense retrieval for fast and relevant document fetching.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large datasets and high query volumes effectively.

## Data Sources
- **Kaggle Dataset**: Utilizes a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle featuring gift items with associated metadata.
- **E-commerce APIs**: Data collected from e-commerce platforms via APIs.
- **Social Media**: Trends and preferences extracted using social media listening tools.
